# DinoBrowse: The Hackable Browser

## v2.0.0

Hi!

I created a electron-based simple browser with Node. So your life would be much easier. Anyway, lets go ahead and install it!

Make sure you clone this repo and cd:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjunj132/dinobrowse.git
cd dinobrowse
```


Lets install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

So now that we installed the dependencies, lets run it! You need python. So, just run:

```bash
python3 -m dino
```

Type the url, the JS code (optional), and then you are done!



## Usage

You might notice that there is not a address bar! You control stuff via the top bar or the right click menu. 

## About

This is a modified version of Chromium. But it is super lightweight!

It great because it contains many features:

- Built in Ad Blocker
- Blocks tracking ads
- Do Not Track header
- Remove Referer
- Mask system information
