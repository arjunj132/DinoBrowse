# DinoBrowse

## v1.0.2

You know what would be fun? Being able to browse the web BUT as soon as the page loads you hack it with JavaScript.

Hmm... Let's try that! I created a electron-based simple browser with Node. So your life would be much easier. Anyway, lets go ahead and install it!

Make sure you clone this repo and cd:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjunj132/dinobrowse.git
cd dinobrowse
```


Lets install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

So now that we installed the dependencies, lets run it! You need python. So, just run:

```bash
python3 -m dino
```

Type the url, the JS code, and then you are done!
